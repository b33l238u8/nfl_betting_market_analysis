## NFL Betting Market Prediction and Analysis

Sports betting is a multi-billion dollar per year industry.  Estimates vary, but the Nevada Gaming Commission reported over $3.2B in legal gambling in 2011, with 41% of that money being wagered on football alone. <sup id="a1">[__1__](#fn1)</sup>  According to NBA commissioner Adam Silver, if illegal gambling is counted the annual total for American gambling jumps to $400B. <sup id="a1">[__2__](#fn2)</sup>   The single biggest betting event in America is the Super Bowl, which now attracts over $100M in legal bets and potentially ten times that amount illegally <sup id="a1">[__3__](#fn3)</sup>  With such sums of money flowing into the betting market, I was curious to see if I could isolate some -- any -- notable inefficiency which would give a leg up on betting intelligently.  The oddsmakers in Vegas use networks of supercomputers to set the odds, so expecting to beat them outright with a single machine learning model is a bad bet, no pun intended.  However, systemic inefficiencies can be ferreted out as Vegas must also set the odds based on __how the public bets__ in order to prevent a catastrophic loss should an upset occur, granting the one-sided public bets all large payouts.  This opens the door for the informed bettor (us) to profit by the uninformed bettors (the public) making bad choices and forcing Vegas to alter the odds in an inefficient manner. In the interest of full disclosure, I have never bet a penny in my life (even on slot machines -- sorry, casinos).
